# Deepfake Detection using CNN-LSTM Model for DFDC Dataset by Facebook

## Dataset:

## Basic Idea
The model makes use of a CNN-LSTM model for deepfake detection. The core premise is to feed the sequence of frames first through a time distributed CNN, and then reshape and pass it through an LSTM which performs the sequence analysis. The outputs are generated by a Dense layer which acts as a binary classifier. 

I have used OpenCV library to assist with face detection and TensorFlow for everything else. The videos are preprocessed to extract the frames, detect faces, and the corresponding directories are used to build the data pipeline. 

The sequence of images is used as input. This model currently does not take audio into consideration but can be extended to take audio as input as well. 

## Remarks

OpenCV is an amazing library, but can at times falter to detect faces, or frankly, anything at all. In order to make sure that I capture as much information from the sequences as possible, I averaged the bounding boxes from the past information in the sequence and used it to detect faces in the images where no face was found
